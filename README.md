# Pile_challenge
Question 1

Write a Pileclass which manages a pile of integers. This class must contain:

­ A default constructor

­ A push function which adds an integer to the pile

­ A pop function which removes and returns an integer from the pile


Question 2

Write the following class methods:

­ print: displays the pile content

­ reverse: reverses the order of pile elements

­ shake: randomly shuffles the order of pile elements


Question 3

A palindromic sequence is an array of integers which reads the same in both ways. For
instance:

[0; 1; 2; 1; 0]

[4; 1; 1; 4]

[]

[78; 78; 78]

Add to the Pileclass the isPalindromicmethod which returns true​if the pile is a
palindromic sequence.

Question 4

Add to the Pileclass the canBePalindromicmethod which returns true​if the pile can be
shuffled so as to obtain a palindromic sequence.
